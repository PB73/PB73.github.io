<h2 id="goal">My goal is that through hard work, a willingness to accept novel opportunities, and a desire to pursue the company of people values I will have lived an authentic and enjoyable life full of meaning, perspective, and giving back. </h2>

<div id="text_line">
<h3>Values:</h3>

<ul>
		<li class="lihead">Travel</li>
			<li class="why">Born and raised in Portland Oregon, and having grown up without the family resources to travel, I now will jump at the opportunity to explore the world around me. I would always prefer to learn through experience.</li>
			
		<li class="lihead">Environment</li>
				<li class="why">Growing up with a less than stable home life, I found the outdoor to be my escape. When I felt powerless to improve my family, I found that I could make a difference by through working in community gardens, developing a compost system for my school, by hacking and slashing my way through invasive blackberry thickets. </li>
		<li class="lihead">Learning &amp; discovery</li>
				<li class="why">As I continue to develop an understanding of ecology, evolution, history, policy, and human resource management I find my outdoor experience means something different. While hiking I am constantly making mental observations and hypothesis and incorporating what I have learned in class.</li>
				<li class="why">Being the first in my family to graduate high school let alone go onto college, I have received lots of support of teachers, professors, consolers, and mentors. They have fostered an interest in learning that has fueled my journey through university, and has opened many doors. I want to both continue expanding my perspective through everything I do, and to also one day be in a position of support and mentorship</li>
		<li class="lihead">Action</li>
				<li class="why">This is where rubber meets the road. Pursuing opportunities to get hands on experience, mentoring, and having an impact. As I complete the final semester of my undergraduate degree, I am itchy to see how my various interests evolve as I enter into the working world.</li> 
	</ul>
</div>



<h3>The Bottom Line:</h3>
	<p>I am fresh out of college and eager to combine my university learning with practical experience. When I accept an opportunity I am making a commitment that I will work my butt off, that I will strive to enjoy my work, that I will stand accountable for my work, and seek ways to improve my work. </p>
