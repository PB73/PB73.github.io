<h3 class="sectional">Values:</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Travel</li>
			<p>Born and raised in Portland Oregon, and having grown up without the family resources to travel, I now will jump at the opportunity to explore the world around me. I would always prefer to learn through experience.</p>
		<li>Environment</li>
			<p>Growing up with a less than stable home life, I found the outdoor to be my escape. When I felt powerless to improve my family, I found that I could make a difference by through working in community gardens, developing a compost system for my school, by hacking and slashing my way through invasive blackberry thickets. </p>
		<li>Learning &amp; discovery</li>
			<p>As I continue to develop an understanding of ecology, evolution, history, policy, and human resource management I find my outdoor experience means something different. While hiking I am constantly making mental observations and hypothesis and incorporating what I have learned in class.</p>
			<p>Being the first in my family to graduate high school let alone go onto college, I have received lots of support of teachers, professors, consolers, and mentors. They have fostered an interest in learning that has fueled my journey through university, and has opened many doors. I want to both continue expanding my perspective through everything I do, and to also one day be in a position of support and mentorship</p>
		<li>Action</li>
			<p>This is where rubber meets the road. Pursuing opportunities to get hands on experience, mentoring, and having an impact. As I complete the final semester of my undergraduate degree, I am itchy to see how my various interests evolve as I enter into the working world.</p> 
	</ul>

<h3 class="sectional">The Bottom Line:</h3>
	<p>I am fresh out of college and eager to combine my university learning with practical experience. When I accept an opportunity I am making a commitment that I will work my butt off, that I will strive to enjoy my work, that I will stand accountable for my work, and seek ways to improve my work. </p>

<p>Though we are separated by distance I would love to hear from you</p>
