    <h3>Values:</h3>
        <div class="values" >
		<dl>
        		<dt class="lihead">Travel</dt>

            			<dd >Born and raised in Portland Oregon, and having grown up without the family resources to travel, I now will jump at the opportunity to explore the world around me. I would always prefer to learn through experience.</dd>

        		<dt class="lihead">Environment</dt>

            				<dd >Growing up with a less than stable home life, I found the outdoor to be my escape. When I felt powerless to improve my family, I found that I could make a difference by through working in community gardens, developing a compost system for my school, by hacking and slashing my way through invasive blackberry thickets. </dd>

        		<dt class="lihead">Learning &amp; discovery</dt>

            				<dd >As I continue to develop an understanding of ecology, evolution, history, policy, and human resource management I find my outdoor experience means something different. While hiking I am constantly making mental observations and hypothesis and incorporating what I have learned in class.</dd>
            				<dd >Being the first in my family to graduate high school let alone go onto college, I have received lots of support of teachers, professors, consolers, and mentors. They have fostered an interest in learning that has fueled my journey through university, and has opened many doors. I want to both continue expanding my perspective through everything I do, and to also one day be in a position of support and mentorship</dd>

        		<dt class="lihead">Action</dt>

            				<dd >This is where rubber meets the road. Pursuing opportunities to get hands on experience, mentoring, and having an impact. As I complete the final semester of my undergraduate degree, I am itchy to see how my various interests evolve as I enter into the working world.</dd>

<h3>The Bottom Line:</h3>
