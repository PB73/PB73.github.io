<h2 id="rev">2 Review of 5 other personal websites</h2>

<ol>
	<li><a href="http://www.pascalvangemert.nl/" target="_blank">Pascal van Gemert</a></li>

		<ul>
			<li>I like the idea of an interactive resume</li>
			<li>The block effect works well with multiple different sections</li>
			<li>I do not like the color choice really</li>
			<li>it also feels a bit like a remake of linkedIn</li>

		</ul>
	<li><a href="http://joshuajohnson.co.uk" target="_blank">Joshua Johnson</a>
		<ul>
			<li>The screenshot of his website, which is a couple of years old, had a very descriptive and a little bit pretentious subheading. I thought it expresses alot of his personality. I would just like to avoid the 						pretentiousness</li>
			<li>it is both a portfolio and blog</li>
		</ul>

	<li><a href="http://ianenders.com/" target="_blank">Ian Enders</a></li>

		<ul>
			<li>his page is literally his name and 13 bullet points that say alot about his personality</li>
			<li>links to projects and relavent sites gives his simple list depth</li>
		</ul>
	<li><a href="http://redrussak.com/" target="_blank">Red Russak</a></li>

		<ul>
			<li>memorable image/caricature- sadly I do not think I have quite that type of appearence</li>
			<li>super simple and it works - mission statement, short list of portfolio items, links to relevant websites</li>
		</ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.stephaniepal.com/" target="_blank">Stephanie Pal</a></li>

		<ul>
			<li>The photo grid is an interesting idea - I could imagine my site having photos of my different job/experiences and linking to a narrative description of them</li>
			<li>the different sections allow for different types of people to get different information about her. it is a multipurpose site</li>
		</ul>
</ol>

<h3>Patrick Baird</h3>

<h4>My goal is that through hard work, willingness to accept novel opportunities, and a desire to pursue people and companies that share my values I will have lived an authentic and enjoyable life full of meaning, perspective, and giving back. </h4>
<h4>Values:</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Travel</strong></li>

Born and raised in Portland Oregon, and having grown up without the family resources to travel, I now will jump at the opportunity to explore the world around me. I would always prefer to learn through experience.
	<li><strong>Environment</strong></li>

Growing up with a less than stable home life, I found the outdoor to be my escape. When I felt powerless to improve my family, I found that I could make a difference by through working in community gardens, developing a compost system for my school, by hacking and slashing my way through invasive blackberry thickets. 
	<li><strong>Learning & discovery</strong></li>

<p>As I continue to develop an understanding of ecology, evolution, history, policy, and human resource management I find my outdoor experience means something different. While hiking I am constantly making mental observations and hypothesis and incorporating what I have learned in class.</p>

<p>Being the first in my family to graduate high school let alone go onto college, I have received lots of support of teachers, professors, consolers, and mentors. They have fostered an interest in learning that has fueled my journey through university, and has opened many doors. I want to both continue expanding my perspective through everything I do, and to also one day be in a position of support and mentorship</p>



	<li><strong>Action</strong></li>

This is where rubber meets the road. Pursuing opportunities to get hands on experience, mentoring, and having an impact. As I complete the final semester of my undergraduate degree, I am itchy to see how my various interests evolve as a get into the working world. 
</ul>
<h4>Contact me:</h4>

Though we are seperated by distance I would love to meet you<br>
